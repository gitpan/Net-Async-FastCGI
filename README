NAME
    `Net::Async::FastCGI' - use FastCGI with IO::Async

SYNOPSIS
    As an adapter:

     use Net::Async::FastCGI;
     use IO::Async::Loop;

     my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new();

     my $fastcgi = Net::Async::FastCGI->new(
        on_request => sub {
           my ( $fastcgi, $req ) = @_;

           # Handle the request here
        }
     );

     $loop->add( $fastcgi );

     $fastcgi->listen(
        service => 1234,
        on_resolve_error => sub { die "Cannot resolve - $_[-1]\n" },
        on_listen_error  => sub { die "Cannot listen - $_[-1]\n" },
     );

     $loop->loop_forever;

    As a subclass:

     package MyFastCGIResponder;
     use base qw( Net::Async::FastCGI );

     sub on_request
     {
        my $self = shift;
        my ( $req ) = @_;

        # Handle the request here
     }

     ...

     use IO::Async::Loop;

     my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new();

     my $fastcgi;
     $loop->add( $fastcgi = MyFastCGIResponder->new( service => 1234 ) );

     $fastcgi->listen(
        service => 1234,
        on_resolve_error => sub { die "Cannot resolve - $_[-1]\n" },
        on_listen_error  => sub { die "Cannot listen - $_[-1]\n" },
     );

     $loop->loop_forever;

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows a program to respond asynchronously to FastCGI
    requests, as part of a program based on IO::Async. An object in this
    class represents a single FastCGI responder that the webserver is
    configured to communicate with. It can handle multiple outstanding
    requests at a time, responding to each as data is provided by the
    program. Individual outstanding requests that have been started but not
    yet finished, are represented by instances of
    Net::Async::FastCGI::Request.

EVENTS
    The following events are invoked, either using subclass methods or CODE
    references in parameters:

  on_request $req
    Invoked when a new FastCGI request is received. It will be passed a new
    Net::Async::FastCGI::Request object.

PARAMETERS
    The following named parameters may be passed to `new' or `configure':

    on_request => CODE
            CODE references for `on_request' event handler.

    default_encoding => STRING
            Sets the default encoding used by all new requests. If not
            supplied then `UTF-8' will apply.

METHODS
  $fcgi->listen( %args )
    Start listening for connections on a socket, creating it first if
    necessary.

    This method may be called in either of the following ways. To listen on
    an existing socket filehandle:

    handle => IO
        An IO handle referring to a listen-mode socket. This is now
        deprecated; use the `handle' key to the `new' or `configure' methods
        instead.

    Or, to create the listening socket or sockets:

    service => STRING
        Port number or service name to listen on.

    host => STRING
        Optional. If supplied, the hostname will be resolved into a set of
        addresses, and one listening socket will be created for each
        address. If not, then all available addresses will be used.

    This method may also require `on_listen_error' or `on_resolve_error'
    callbacks for error handling - see IO::Async::Listener for more detail.

Limits in FCGI_GET_VALUES
    The `FCGI_GET_VALUES' FastCGI request can enquire of the responder the
    maximum number of connections or requests it can support. Because this
    module puts no fundamental limit on these values, it will return some
    arbitrary numbers. These are given in package variables:

     $Net::Async::FastCGI::MAX_CONNS = 1024;
     $Net::Async::FastCGI::MAX_REQS  = 1024;

    These variables are provided in case the containing application wishes
    to make the library return different values in the request. These values
    are not actually used by the library, other than to fill in the values
    in response of `FCGI_GET_VALUES'.

Using a socket on STDIN
    When running a local FastCGI responder, the webserver will create a new
    INET socket connected to the script's STDIN file handle. To use the
    socket in this case, it should be passed as the `handle' argument.
